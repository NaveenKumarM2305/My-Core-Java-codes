/*Restrictions for the static method
There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:

1.The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
2. this and super cannot be used in static context.

		 A obj = new A();
		 //System.out.println(a);
		 /*CTE as we cannot access non-static variable inside static variable directly
		  we should create the instance of a class(Object) and then access them in static block*/

/*
Why is the Java main method static?
Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method,
 JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
