  Ways to achieve Abstraction
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

1. Abstract class (0 to 100%)
2. Interface (100%)


A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember
a. An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
b. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
c. It cannot be instantiated.
d. It can have constructors and static methods also.
e. It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

	public  void sample() { // Concrete method
		int a =10;

	public abstract void demo();// Asbtract method 
	// Notes n = new Notes();    // Cannot create the Object of the abstract class
	

}
